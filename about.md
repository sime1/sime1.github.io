# About me
{: .title}

Hello, I'm Simeone Pizzi and this is my website.

I'm an italian developer with some experience in distributed systems, Cloud
services, NoSQL databases.

I mostly program in either Go or javascript (Node.js), and sometimes in C/C++,
but I always like learning new programming languages.

My interests range from Cloud Native applications, DevOps and Continuous
Integration to embedded development and neural networks.

I play the guitar, I like reading and going for walks, and I'm really bad at
videogames.

If you wish to contact me, you can find my contacts on the column on the right
or, if you are from mobile, at the bottom of this page.
